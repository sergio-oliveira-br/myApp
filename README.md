## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Development:**
  - **HTML & CSS:** Structuring and styling the user interface, with responsive design supported by Bootstrap.
  - **JavaScript:** Enables real-time interaction with backend services, dynamic interface behaviour, and AJAX requests for asynchronous data exchange. This improves user experience by allowing updates without reloading the entire page. 

- **Backend Development:**
  - **Java:** The applicationâ€™s core is built in Java, leveraging its modularity and reusability.
  - **Spring Boot:** A framework that simplifies backend configuration and enables the development of standalone applications with minimal setup.
  - **Maven:** Used for dependency management and project building.
  - **Jakarta:** Facilitates the creation of entities and business models.
  - **JPA (Java Persistence API):** Manages the creation and manipulation of database tables.
  - **RESTful API:** Facilitates communication between frontend and backend through RESTful services for data operations (CRUD).
 
- **Database:**
  - **PostgreSQL:** The application uses PostgreSQL in production. PostgreSQL is known for its reliability, efficiency, and robustness in managing data, providing secure storage and fast retrieval of information.

- **Hosting:**
  - **Heroku:** The application is hosted on Heroku, providing a scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure with a simplified deployment process.
