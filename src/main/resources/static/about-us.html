                <h2 class="section-title">Purpose and Objective</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    AluControl was developed as part of my academic journey toward completing the
                    <span class="highlight">Higher Diploma in Science in Computing</span>, specializing in
                    <span class="highlight">Software Development</span> at the
                    <span class="highlight">National College of Ireland</span>.
                    This application was built primarily as a learning tool to implement core concepts in
                    <span class="highlight">Spring Security</span>, focusing on real-world applications such as user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                    This project is not a commercial product but a showcase of my ability to integrate various technologies and frameworks to build a functional system. The main goal here is to demonstrate continuous learning and development through the practical application of academic concepts.

                <h2 class="section-title">Key Focus Areas</h2>
                <ul class="section-content">
                    <li><strong>Academic Learning Applied in Practice:</strong> Each feature of AluControl demonstrates how academic theories are applied in real-world development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> The platform is an ongoing project that applies clean code practices, modular design, and user-centric enhancements.</li>

                <h2 class="section-title">Future Developments: Towards Microservices</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    Although AluControl is currently a monolithic application, one of the next steps is to evolve towards a <span class="highlight">microservices architecture</span>. This transition will allow me to explore more advanced design patterns and technologies, such as:
                </p>
                <ul class="section-content">
                    <li><strong>Spring Cloud:</strong> Implementing distributed systems using Spring Cloud for service discovery, load balancing, and centralized configuration management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Messaging Systems:</strong> Incorporating message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous communication between services, improving scalability and fault tolerance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitoring and Observability:</strong> Implementing solutions like Prometheus and Grafana for tracking service health, performance metrics, and logs in a microservices environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resiliency and Fault Tolerance:</strong> Using tools like Hystrix to ensure system reliability under high load and fault conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="section-content">
                    This evolution to microservices will enhance my understanding of distributed systems, scalability, and the challenges of managing multiple independent services. The goal is to create a more robust, flexible, and scalable version of AluControl.
