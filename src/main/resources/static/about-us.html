                <h2 class="section-title">Purpose and Objective</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    AluControl was developed as part of my academic journey toward completing the
                    <span class="highlight">Higher Diploma in Science in Computing</span>, specializing in
                    <span class="highlight">Software Development</span> at the
                    <span class="highlight">National College of Ireland</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The primary goal of this project is to create a centralized business automation system
                    that optimizes the management of sales and inventory operations,
                    improving efficiency and supporting decision-making through real-time reporting and automation.

                <p class="section-content">
                    This project is not a commercial product but a showcase of
                    my ability to integrate various technologies and frameworks to build a functional system.
                    The main goal here is to demonstrate continuous learning
                    and development through the practical application of academic concepts.

                    <li><strong>Academic Learning Applied in Practice:</strong> Each feature of AluControl demonstrates how academic theories are applied in real-world development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> The platform is an ongoing project that applies clean code practices, modular design, and user-centric enhancements.</li>

                    Although AluControl is currently a monolithic application,
                    one of the next steps is to evolve towards a
                    <span class="highlight">microservices architecture</span>.
                    This transition will allow me to explore more advanced design patterns and technologies, such as:

                    This platform is continuously evolving,
                    with new features and enhancements being added regularly.
                    The goal is not only to build a functional system but
                    to deepen my understanding and practice of software development,
                    security protocols, and system design.
